        <span class="dropcap">M</span>any companies spend lots of resources and
        effort to create a blog that supports their business, particularly the
        sales process. Yet many corporate bloggers complain that while blogs
        contain relevant information and attract visitors, they can’t track how
        their blog has influenced sales. Social media has raised customers’
        expectations about the information they need before they purchase. If
        your blog content is relevant to prospects’ and customers’ needs before
        and after purchase and your products deliver on their promise, you can
        convert your blog into a sales machine.

      <h3>3 cs of using your blog to sell</h3>
      <div class="topic">
        <p>
          <strong>Content.</strong> Provide useful, educational and entertaining
          content. Present information based on your product offering and
          customers’ problems or needs. <br /><br />
          <strong> Context. </strong>While your end goal is to sell, consider
          the context of your blog posts. Here, you’re a tour guide through your
          firm’s extended offering – not an auctioneer. Your job is to show
          readers how to use your firm’s products. <br /><br />
          <strong> Commerce. </strong> Once you’ve given your readers useful
          information in a meaningful setting, they may be interested in
          actually plunking down their credit card. Unfortunately, here’s where
          many business blogs stop. Blog editors, familiar with their company’s
          e-commerce site and how to find specific products, can assume readers
          innately know how to find the product or have the motivation to track
          it down. Don’t get me wrong. Some very small percentage of prospects
          will to go extreme efforts to find the product. Unfortunately, the
          rest will just leave or worse go to your competitor.

      <h3>Ways to convert your traffic to sales</h3>
      <p>
        To make your blog an effective sales machine, integrate your product
        into your content in a way that doesn’t scream BUY, BUY, BUY. Here are
        five steps to provide relevant information and eye-candy to lure readers
        in and help convert blog posts to sales receipts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Provide useful, relevant information.</b> Show prospects how to use
        your product, give them instructions or how-tos, and/or entertain them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Include a variety of different forms of content.</b> Photographs and
        videos are particularly important because readers tend to be visual and
        want to see your product in action.

      <p>
        <b>Make it easy to buy by eliminating stumbling blocks to purchase.</b>
        Don’t assume customers know which item you’re talking about in your
        post. Provide a link directly to the product page or just link the
        product to your blog so they can buy if they want. If it relevant give
        readers more than one way to get to the product.
